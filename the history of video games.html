a space combat system that was for the PDP-1 or the Programmed data Processor-1. This was the first video game that was able to be played on multiple installations.</li>
        <li> although that was a start for home gaming on computers, the real first home-console system was known as "The Brown Box," developed by Sanders Associates, Inc. in 1967.
This was a prototype multiplayer, multi-program system that was able to be played on the T.V.</li>
        <li> considered the first official home console system was the Odyssey, in the year 1972. this console would sadly fizzle out and die, however, one of the 28 games that were created
would later become the inspiration for Atari's Pong. the first arcade video game, which was released in 1972. In 75', however, Atari released a home version of their game, which was just as successful
as its arcade version.</li>
        <li> In 1977, Atari would release their console known as the Atari 2600, this home console featured joysticks and interchangable video game cartridges that played multi-colored games.</li>
      </ul>

Another reason had to do with the competition from computer gaming. there was also a massive amount of games that had little care or even low-quality games coming out, one of which was the horrible E.T. Atari game, 
which was so rushed that it is considered the worlds worstvideo game. this crash would last for a couple years and it led to the bankruptcy of several home computer and video game console companies.</p>
